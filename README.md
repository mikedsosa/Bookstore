Assignment Description

"Jeff Bezos was 30 years old when he quit his job and founded Amazon in 1994, selling books
online out of his garage. His parents provided the seed money of $250,000. Amazon launched
their website in 1995, where revenue totaled $511,000 in their first five months. After receiving
an additional $8 million in funding in 1996, total revenue that year jumped up to $15.7 million.
The company went public in 1997, just shy of three years after the company was founded, and
Bezos made an approximate $54 million in that IPO. By 1999, five years after starting Amazon,
Bezos made his first appearance on the Billionaires list. He has said: “A brand for a company is
like a reputation for a person. You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well.”
It took a full year to develop, test, and debug the Amazon website. We are going to build
something similar in just a few weeks using ASP.NET Core MVC over the course of the next
few assignments. This assignment focuses on creating the database portion of the web app.
Create a web app for an online bookstore. For each book, we want to store the following
information:

• Title

• Author

• Publisher

• ISBN

• Classification/Category

• Price

All fields are required. Use the “Model First” approach described in the videos to set up and
create the database that we will use for the app. The ISBN needs to be entered in a valid format.
Include a “BookId” field that can be used as a primary key. Use good normalization principles
(i.e. no non-atomic fields, no repeating groups).

Seed the database using some of Prof. Hilton’s favorite books he’s read over the last few years
(found in the table on the next page).
Once the database has been created, list out all the books from the database on the Index view.
Be sure to style your page using Bootstrap.
